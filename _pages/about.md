I am a Ph.D. student in the Neuroscience and Cognitive Science program at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I am advised by [Jan Edwards](https://hesp.umd.edu/facultyprofile/edwards/jan) and [Jared Novick](https://hesp.umd.edu/facultyprofile/novick/jared). 
Broadly speaking, I'm interested in both the cognitive and educational implications of language variation.
I'm part of the [UMD ToggleTalk Project](https://learningtotalk.umd.edu/toggletalk/), an efficacy study of a dialect-shifting curriculum, and I have led our effort to understand teachers' attitudes toward their students' non-mainstream dialect.

Before coming to UMD, I received my B.A. and M.A. in Linguistics at Yale University, where I was a founding member of the [Yale Grammatical Diversity Project](https://ygdp.yale.edu/). I was also a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in Berlin, Germany, and I worked at an educational foundation in Newark, NJ.
