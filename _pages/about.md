I am a Ph.D. student in the Neuroscience and Cognitive Science program at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I am advised by Jan Edwards and Jared Novick. Broadly speaking, I am interested in both the cognitive and educational implications of language variation.  I am interested in both the cognitive and educational implications of language variation. There is an intuitive notion that processing a less familiar dialect or switching between dialects is "difficult," and my research seeks a mechanistic account of such difficulty. In particular, I appeal to cognitive control mechanisms engaged to navigate competing linguistic representations. I am also interested in the long-term impact of exposure to multiple dialects, with an applied focus on the acquisition of non-mainstream dialects and the impact of exposure to the standard variety in school. I am part of the UMD ToggleTalk Project, an efficacy study of a dialect-shifting curriculum, and I have led our effort to understand teachers' attitudes toward their students' non-mainstream dialect.

Before coming to UMD, I received my B.A. and M.A. in Linguistics at Yale University, where I was a founding member of the Yale Grammatical Diversity Project. I was also a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in Berlin, Germany, and I worked at an educational foundation in Newark, NJ.
