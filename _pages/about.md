I am interested in the cognitive mechanisms engaged in the processing of grammatical variation. There is an intuitive notion that processing a less familiar dialect or switching between dialects is "difficult," and my research seeks a mechanistic account of such difficulty. In particular, I appeal to cognitive control mechanisms engaged to navigate competing linguistic representations. I am also interested in the long-term impact of exposure to multiple dialects, with an applied focus on the acquisition of non-mainstream dialects and the impact of exposure to the standard variety in school.
