# Hi, I'm Zach. Welcome to my website!

I am a language scientist and NSF-SPRF Postdoctoral Fellow at Penn State, where I am a member of the [Bilingualism and Linguistic Diversity Lab](https://bild.la.psu.edu/). I'm interested in how people navigate a world that is filled with language variation. Most of my work focuses on morphosyntactic (grammatical) variation, including differences between [African American Language](https://oraal.uoregon.edu) (AAL) and Mainstream ("Standard") American English. 

My primary work frames variation as a cognitive phenomenon, asking how people represent and process morphosyntactic differences across language varieties (dialects). I have used a variety of methods to address this question, including eye-tracking and various behavioral measures, and in my post doc, I'm using EEG. In other work, I have studied the effects of a sociolinguistically-informed intervention, examining its impact on AAL-speaking children's reading growth and their teachers' language ideologies.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, where I was advised by Jan Edwards and Jared Novick, and I completed my B.A. and M.A. in Linguistics at Yale, where I was a founding member of the [Yale Grammatical Diversity Project](https://ygdp.yale.edu/).
